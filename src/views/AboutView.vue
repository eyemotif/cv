        Over 5 years of working with Typescript, Vue, C#, Java, as well as many other kinds of frontend and backend
        technologies, I've built up a thorough foundation of full-stack development knowledge, which allows me to create
        robust and scalable applications.

        My love for computers and videogames, which started as far back as when I was in
        elementary school, quickly evolved into a passion for learning all things programming, as well as building many
        programming projects over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
        I always have a finger on the pulse of the current affairs and technologies of
        software development, which combined with my articulate communication, makes me a perfect fit for working on even
        more ambitious projects that can further elevate my professional capabilities.
